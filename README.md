DATA
Data folder "test_dataset" including three folders
"acetate"
"DWTP-G"
"DWTP-N"
info_dataset.docx

All the data files described above contain the following information:

1. one .xlsx file containing the raw data form the PreSens sensor vials including time stamps
2. one autoresults.csv file, created by the algorithm and renewed everytime the algorithm for the corresponding raw data in the foder is run.
3. one output folder, created by the algorithm and renewed everytime the algorithm for the corresponding raw data in the foder is run. This folder containins figures of the different steps included in the algorithm. 

 
Methods, materials and software:
Oxygen concentrations were logged every three minutes for a minimum of three days.

To run the data:
Open 
oxygen_analysis_automated_2021_LOCr_paper.m
AOCsetup2021.m
AOCoutliers2021.m

In oxygen_analysis_automated_2021_LOCr_paper.m un-comment which case to run and comment the remaining cases

Example:
"""

% specify the substrate type for this dataset. It will determine the threshold for detecting peaks

%NOM_substrate = 'test-dataset-DWTP-G';
%NOM_substrate = 'test-dataset-DWTP-N';
NOM_substrate = 'test-dataset-acetate';

"""

In AOCsetup2021.m the parameters such as start and end time, smoothing and names are declared. This has already been done for the three example test data sets.

Example:
"""
    case 'test-dataset-DWTP-G' 
        ExptNum=1;
        cd('test_dataset\DWTP-G\');
        grp={'G-1','G-1','G-1','G-1','G-2','G-2','G-2','G-2','G-3','G-3','G-3','G-3','G-4','G-4','G-4','G-4','X1','X1','X1','X1','X2','X2','X2','X2'};

        EndHour=70; %89h

        y_secondplot=[150,400];
        StPt=20 %for plotting derivatives
"""

In AOCoutliers2021.m the outliers are given as inputs, first which sample thehn which replicate. The current inputs are in agreement with the published data 

Example:
"""
   case 'test-dataset-DWTP-G'
        OutlierGrp=cellstr(char('G-3')); %Name the plots that have bad lines
        OutlierCol=[4]; %dk blue=1,red=2, yellow=3,purple=4,green=5,light blue=6
